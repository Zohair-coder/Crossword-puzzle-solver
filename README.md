# Crossword Puzzle Solver

Checks if a given word is in a board (vertically, horizontally, diagonally, antidiagonally and in reverse direction for all cases as well).

## Usage

Open the program solver.py in a text editor and scroll down till you find the "board" 2D array in the main function. Change the board and word to whatever your values are. If the word is present, the program will return True, otherwise it will return False.
